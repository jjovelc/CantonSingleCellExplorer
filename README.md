Welcome to the RShiny App for Analyzing Seurat Results! This interactive application allows you to visualize and analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data processed with the Seurat package. By inputting your own Seurat object (.RDS file), you can generate various plots and perform analyses such as finding marker genes and conducting differential expression analysis.

This guide will help you understand how to use the app, load your data, and make the most of its plotting and analysis capabilities.
